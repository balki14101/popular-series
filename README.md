# Netflix-Clone

Netflix-Clone App is a simple version of cloning which contains 2 screens[Top 20 TvShows List Screen and Its details Screen].
It uses APIs from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) - The Movie Database.
This is my first step of cloning a real-world application.
